The executable file requires Python 3.

1. Download and move the executable slcsp.py to the folder where the csv files are (plans.csv, zips.csv, slcsp.csv).
2. The file slcsp should contain the set of zip codes for which you want to find their SCLSP.
3. Open a Linux/Mac terminal and go to the folder where you have the files in step 1.
4. Run the command: python slcsp.py	
5. In the current folder, a new file slcsp_assigned.csv will be created which will have the SLCSP rates assigned for each zip code.
